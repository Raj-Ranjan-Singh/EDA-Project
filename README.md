# Bank-Customer-Churn-Dataset EDA Using Python

About the Dataset:
This Dataset contains the information about the customers(10000+ customers) that have an
account in the bank, their credit scores, the country they belong to, their gender, age, their
tenure, their current balance deposited in the bank, products/policies/Term deposits that they
have enrolled for in the bank, whether they have a credit card or not, whether they have been
an active member or not, what’s their estimated salary, and finally the most important column
that is whether they’ll be churned out of the bank or not.
